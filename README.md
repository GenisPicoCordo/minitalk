## ABOUT
This is a server/client system that uses UNIX signals for communication. The server displays its PID and receives decrypted signals as characters, while the client encrypts messages and sends true/false signals using SIGUSR1 or SIGUSR2 to the server's PID.

## HOW TO USE
#### 1º - Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jotavare/minitalk
```

#### 2º - Enter the project folder and run `make`

cd minitalk/minitalk
make
```

#### 3º - Run server or server_bonus and copy its PID
```bash
./server
./server_bonus
```

#### 4º - Open another terminal, run client or client_bonus, paste the PID and write a message
```bash
./client [SERVER PID] [MESSAGE]
./client_bonus [SERVER PID] [MESSAGE] [EMOTE]
```

#### MAKEFILE RULES

`make` - Compile minitalk **mandatory** files.

`make bonus` - Compile minitalk **bonus** files.

`make all` - Compile **mandatory** + **bonus** files.

`make clean` - Delete all .o (object files) files.

`make fclean` - Delete all .o (object files) and .a (executable) files.

`make re` - Use rules `fclean` + `all`.
